# Biophysical-Principles-of-Avian-High-Speed-Wing-Architecture

This project initiates in my summer internship at Caltech, exploring how mimicking the geometry of birds with high-speed wings (a biological classification) could bring benefits to aeroelasticity performances of a wing without hindering aerodynamic efficiency. 

After the internship, I returned to China with theoretical results and an initial design, then tested them at Tongji University's automobile wind tunnel. Then, I made revisions to my work and started constructing prototypes. 

This was actually a long process. Although I have successfully parametrized the wing and found suitable coefficients, the geometry also brings problems with connection and airframes during construction, which is indeed one of the limitations to this design. 

Nevertheless, as I improved on the design, I also entered Real World Design Challenge and Conrad Challenge with teams featuring twists based on the original high-speed wing design to be applied on realistic scenarios.
